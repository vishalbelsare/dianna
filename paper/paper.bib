	Abstract = {This paper reviews some of the challenges posed by the huge growth of experimental data generated by the new generation of large-scale experiments at UK national facilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) site at Harwell near Oxford. Such 'Big Scientific Data' comes from the Diamond Light Source and Electron Microscopy Facilities, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility and the UK's Central Laser Facility. Increasingly, scientists are now required to use advanced machine learning and other AI technologies both to automate parts of the data pipeline and to help find new scientific discoveries in the analysis of their data. For commercially important applications, such as object recognition, natural language processing and automatic translation, deep learning has made dramatic breakthroughs. Google's DeepMind has now used the deep learning technology to develop their AlphaFold tool to make predictions for protein folding. Remarkably, it has been able to achieve some spectacular results for this specific scientific problem. Can deep learning be similarly transformative for other scientific problems? After a brief review of some initial applications of machine learning at the RAL, we focus on challenges and opportunities for AI in advancing materials science. Finally, we discuss the importance of developing some realistic machine learning benchmarks using Big Scientific Data coming from several different scientific domains. We conclude with some initial examples of our 'scientific machine learning' benchmark suite and of the research challenges these benchmarks will enable. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Numerical algorithms for high-performance computational science'.},

We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations used by different components of the trained model and show that encoding of semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers, whereas encoding of form-related aspects of the language input tends to initially increase and then plateau or decrease.",

  title = "On the difficulty of a distributional semantics of spoken language",
  abstract = "The bulk of research in the area of speech processing concerns itself with supervised approaches to transcribing spoken language into text. In the domain of unsupervised learning most work on speech has focused on discovering relatively low level constructs such as phoneme inventories or word-like units. This is in contrast to research on written language, where there is a large body of work on unsupervised induction of semantic representations of words and whole sentences and longer texts. In this study we examine the challenges of adapting these approaches from written to spoken language. We conjecture that unsupervised learning of spoken language semantics becomes possible if we abstract from the surface variability. We simulate this setting by using a dataset of utterances spoken by a realistic but uniform synthetic voice. We evaluate two simple unsupervised models which, to varying degrees of success, learn semantic representations of speech fragments. Finally we suggest possible routes toward transferring our methods to the domain of unrestricted natural speech. ",
